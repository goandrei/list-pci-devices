# PCI Devices Lister

## About

It shows the devices used by your computer. It is similar to the 'lspci' command in Unix-like operating systems, but a lot simpler.

## The output

It outputs various details about your components which could be used for troubleshooting. Just search your vendor_id - device_id 
on a devices database like https://devicehunt.com/.

## Example

BUS 0 DEVICE 0 FUNCTION 0 VENDOR_ID = 8086 DEVICE_ID = 191f
